# NexteraStyleIndexPrimers
## v1
Primers containing 8-mer length index bases.
## v2 for combinatorial dual indexing
All primers contain 8-mer length index bases for combinatorial dual indexing. 192 forward index primers and 288 reverse index primers are available. A set of forward and reverse index primers for a 96-well plate contain 8 and 12 primers, respectively. 8 forward indices conrain 1 to 3 each bases at the same positions. 12 reverse indices contain 2 to 4 each bases at the same positions.
## v3 for unique dual indexing
All primers contain 10-mer length index bases for unique dual indexing. 3840 forward index primers and 3840 reverse index primers are available. A set of index primers for a 96-well plate contain 96 primers. 96 indices contain 12 to 48 each bases at the same positions. Both M (A or C) and K (G or T) bases are controlled within a range of 39 to 57 at the same positions.
